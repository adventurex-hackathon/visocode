  "explanation": {
    "content": "The freshest medical-AI frontier is 4DNeX: a single photo → living 3-D scene. Picture a CT scan frozen in time; now imagine sliding a slider that lets the heart beat and the lung inflate while you orbit the body. 4DNeX learns this motion by treating every pixel as a 6-D vector (RGB + XYZ) through time. A pretrained video-diffusion backbone is fine-tuned on 10 million synthetic 4-D clips, so the network sees how voxels flow instead of guessing. The key invariant: local motion is smooth—neighboring points move coherently. A tiny example: a 32-frame sequence of a beating left-ventricle is compressed to a 6-D latent; the decoder re-expands it to any viewpoint/time, letting cardiologists inspect valve motion from angles never scanned."
